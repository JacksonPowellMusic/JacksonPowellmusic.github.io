We began with a website that was only published thru a read me. Not an html.
We worked on designing the site as an html file while simultaneously writing the text and inserting the images.
We tried to publish it but for some reason it wasn't working. Rachel came to the rescue and helped with the capitalization and smaller formatting errors.
Once we redid the index . html file and committed the website worked and it was BEAUTIFUL!
